To get this deployed somewhere accessible, I'm going to roll with firebase. This is primary a function of convenience as I have existing projects deployed using firebase. The gotcha, however, is getting the secret in the first place. I'm going to use the firebase cli to get the token via a docker node image.

``` shell
docker run -it frison/dev:node
```

Within the node container, you'll need to run the following:

``` shell
sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login:ci --no-localhost
```

Follow the onscreen instructions and you'll get a token that you can use to deploy your site.
